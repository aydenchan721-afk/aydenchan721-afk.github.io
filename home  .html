    <P>To all of our loyal customers, it is with mixed emotions that we will be closing the doors to our refillery come end of June. This was a very difficult decision, but with the tough economy, rising rent, and other external factors, it was the right one for us.

Over the last few years, we have had many dedicated refillers through our doors, and for that, we are so thankful. We have enjoyed hearing your stories, chatting, and even watching your families grow. We have also worked with some amazing brands over the last few years, and will forever be grateful to everyone making a difference for our planet. 

We will be restocking more popular items for a while (ie. hand soap, dish soap, liquid laundry soap, vinegars, eggs, etc). We will also be doing pre-orders for larger quantities of certain items if you'd like to stock up before we close. 

If you have a remaining gift card balance, we encourage you to come use it before the store closes. If you can't make it to the store, you can shop online, as we will be doing a few more delivery runs and also shipping as usual. 

Deposit jars can be returned for credit as well, but you are also welcome to keep and reuse the jars. 

We will provide more details on our social media pages as they come. If you have any questions for us, we are here to answer them. 

Thank you for being low-waste warriors with us over the last few years. 💚

-The Earth Market Team</P>
