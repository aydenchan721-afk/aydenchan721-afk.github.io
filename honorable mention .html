    <h1>The History of Basketball</h1>

    <p>
      Basketball dates back to 1891, when it was invented by James Naismith at the International YMCA Training School in Springfield, Massachusetts.
      The sport was created as a less injury-prone alternative to football and quickly evolved into a popular game.

    <p>Basketball is one of my biggest hobbies, and I really love the sport.</p>
