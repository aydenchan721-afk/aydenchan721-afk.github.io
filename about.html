 <strong>Why Zero Waste?</strong>
  <P>  
Only 11% of the plastic used in Canada is recycled. That means nearly 90% ends up in landfills, incinerators, or the environment (including the oceans and Great Lakes).

Despite growing concerns about plastic pollution, Canada doesn't have a national framework for managing plastics.
(Canada's Plastic Pollution Problem: Report)

We believe that a solution exists, and it starts with each individual. Collectively, we can make a change.

Rethink: Purchase products made from reused, recycled or sustainably-harvested, non-toxic materials. Support systems where product manufacturers consider the full life-cycle of their product.
Reduce: Plan consumption, and implement sustainable purchasing that supports social and environmental objectives, as well as local markets where possible.
Reuse: Maximize reuse of materials and products. Maintain, repair or refurbish to retain value, usefulness, and function.

Every little bit counts.</P>

  <strong>Meet the Owner</strong><p>
I live in a two-person household. I realized we were producing too much waste when we could easily fill two recycling bins, and a garbage bin every week or two. I actively began searching for low waste solutions to the products that I purchased regularly (namely household and groceries). Sourcing low waste essentials locally was more challenging than I anticipated. Recognizing a need, and after many months of research and hard work, Earth Market was born.</P>
